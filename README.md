SkinSafe is an AI-powered tele-dermatology platform designed to improve access to dermatological care by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Users can upload images of their skin conditions via a mobile app developed using Flutter, which are then analyzed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The AI model classifies potential skin conditions, providing a confidence score and suggesting possible next steps, such as seeking a dermatological consultation. The mobile app allows for easy image capture, secure uploads, and offers an interactive interface for users to communicate with professionals, ensuring enhanced accessibility, especially in rural or underserved areas. SkinSafe aims to reduce the time, cost, and barriers involved in seeking dermatological care, making it possible for individuals to monitor and address skin conditions remotely. The app's AI model is designed to assist in early detection, particularly for skin conditions like melanoma, acne, and eczema.
